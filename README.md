# Visual Basic for Applications Extension Library
A standardized tool library used to bring modern library functions to legacy VBA applications. Includes classes such as StringBuilder, SqlBuilder, a basic Object-Relational Mapper, wrappers around Active Directory and Windows registry APIs. Some of the classes extend native VBA types (marked by the 'ex' suffix) and are called as static helper methods by setting the hidden VB_PredeclaredId attribute.
